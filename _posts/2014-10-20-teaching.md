We provide bioinformatics training through both **shorter workshops** and **in-depth courses**.

** *[The application process is now open](http://tinyurl.com/ngs-course-fall-2016) for an 8-day in-depth NGS Data Analysis Course focused on RNA Sequencing! Go to [http://tinyurl.com/ngs-course-fall-2016](http://tinyurl.com/ngs-course-fall-2016) for more information and a link to the pre-registration page.* **

#### 1. Workshops 

* **Next Generation Sequencing Introduction Series**

	([Galaxy-based](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/)) workshops on RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq to introduce basic concepts of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. The goal of these workshops are to enable researchers to design their studies appropriately and perform preliminary data analyses.

* **Basic Bioinformatics Skills Series**	

	Topics include R, data visualization using R, Python programming, Unix and high-performance computing (duration varies from half a day to three days).

#### 2.  In-Depth Next Generation Sequencing Analysis Courses

These intensive courses run for 10-12 days and are aimed at bench biologists interested in learning **how to perform independent, best practice NGS-based analyses**. Topics include:

- Unix & High-Performance Computing ([Orchestra](https://rc.hms.harvard.edu/#orchestra))
- NGS data analysis (RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, Variant calling)
- Statistical analysis using R
- Functional analysis


*No prior NGS or command line expertise is required for our workshops or courses unless explicitly stated.*

### Upcoming workshops/courses:

* **February 8th and 9th, 2017: *Introduction to R***
  
	This 2-day hands-on workshop will introduce participants to using R and RStudio. After this workshop participants can expect to be comfortable with the basics of data manipulation and plotting using R.
	
	** *Registration will open on January 17th, 2017!* **

* **February 14th, 2017: *Introduction to Differential Gene Expression analysis***

	This 1-day hands-on workshop is designed to teach researchers the basic concepts for performing differential gene expression analysis using tools in R. 
	
	**Pre-requisite: *Introduction to R* ** (You are eligibile to attend only if you have taken an R workshop with us previously.)

* **Spring 2017 workshops schedule will be announced soon!**
