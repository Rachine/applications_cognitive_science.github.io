Part of our mission as a service core to the HMS community is to **provide bioinformatics training**. We are doing this through workshops, in-depth courses and individual consults.


### Workshop program 

Each month we run **one-day ([Galaxy-based](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/)) [NGS workshops](http://hbc.github.io/ngs-workshops/)** on RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, re-sequencing and other topics. These provide a basic understanding of the underlying technology and help with study designs and preliminary data analysis. No prior NGS or command line expertise is required. 

<br>**Please check back here in June for information about upcoming courses!**

<br>**For any training-related questions, please email us at [hbctraining@hsph.harvard.edu](mailto:hbctraining@hsph.harvard.edu)**
