Part of our mission as a service core to the HMS community is to **provide bioinformatics training**. We are doing this through workshops, in-depth courses and individual consults.


### Workshop program 

We offer bioiformatics training workshops in several formats:

* One-day ([Galaxy-based](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/)) [NGS workshops](http://hbc.github.io/ngs-workshops/) on RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq: introduces basic concepts of NGS analysis using the easy point-and-click Galaxy interface. Enables researchers to design their studies appropriately and perform preliminary data analysis. 
* Workshops for basic bioinformatics skills including R, data visualization using R, Python programming, Unix and high-performance computing (varies from half a day to three days) 
* In-depth NGS analysis courses: 10-12 day courses designed to train researchers to independently perform a sequencing-based analyses using the Unix command line interface, R, and high-performance computing. 
 
*No prior NGS or command line expertise is required for most of our workshops unless stated explicitly.*

Please see below for a list of our Summer and Fall offerings; we will be adding more courses, announcing the dates for the fall courses, and adding links to the sign-up pages as soon as they become available.

***Upcoming workshops/courses:***

* **[In-depth NGS data analysis course](http://tinyurl.com/ngs-course-feb2016)**: 2-days a week for 5 weeks starting on February 8th. 

This intensive course will introduce partcipants to UNIX, High-Performance Computing, R, and enable them to perform Next-Generation Sequence (NGS) data analysis independently.
