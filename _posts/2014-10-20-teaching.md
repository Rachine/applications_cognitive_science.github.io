Part of our mission as a service core to the HMS community is to **provide bioinformatics training**. We are doing this through workshops, in-depth courses and individual consults.


### Workshop program 

Each month we run **one-day ([Galaxy-based](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/)) [NGS workshops](http://hbc.github.io/ngs-workshops/)** on RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, re-sequencing and other topics. These provide a basic understanding of the underlying technology and help with study designs and preliminary data analysis. No prior NGS or command line expertise is required. 

Please see below for a list of our Summer and Fall offerings; we will be adding more courses, announcing the dates for the fall courses, and adding links to the sign-up pages as soon as they become available.

* **June 26th**, 9am - 5pm: **Introduction to R and R graphics with ggplot2** (in collaboration with [IQSS](http://www.iq.harvard.edu/))
* **July 17th**, 9am - 5pm: **RNA-Seq with Galaxy**
* **July 22nd**, 9am - 12:30pm: **A Hands-on Introduction to Python** (in collaboration with [IQSS](http://www.iq.harvard.edu/))
