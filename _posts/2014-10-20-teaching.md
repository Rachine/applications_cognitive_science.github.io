## 1. Workshops 

* **Next Generation Sequencing Introduction Series**

	([Galaxy-based](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/)) workshops on RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq to introduce basic concepts of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. The goal of these workshops are to enable researchers to design their studies appropriately and perform preliminary data analyses.

* **Basic Bioinformatics Skills Series**	

	Topics include R, data visualization using R, Python programming, UNIX/shell and high-performance computing (duration varies from half a day to three days).

## 2.  In-Depth Next Generation Sequencing Analysis Courses

These intensive courses run for 10-12 days and are aimed at bench biologists interested in learning **how to perform independent, best practice NGS-based analyses**. Topics include:

- Unix & High-Performance Computing ([Orchestra](https://rc.hms.harvard.edu/#orchestra))
- NGS data analysis (RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, Variant calling)
- Statistical analysis using R
- Functional analysis

*No prior NGS or command line expertise is required for our workshops or courses unless explicitly stated.*
