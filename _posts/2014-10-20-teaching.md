### Upcoming workshops/courses:

* **April 3rd and 4th, 2017: *Introduction to R***

  This 2-day hands-on workshop will introduce participants to using R and RStudio. After this workshop participants can expect to be comfortable with the basics of data manipulation and plotting using R.
  
  ** *Registration is [now open! Click here](https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=214443667) for more details* **
  
* **May 31st - June 29th, 2017: *In-depth NGS data analysis course***
  
  This 10-day in-depth course will instruct participants on the theoretical and practical concepts related to Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis, enabling them to perform these analyses independently. This class includes an additional 2 day session in early August; the topics for this session will inclue Variant Calling and Git/Github.

* **May 17th to May 19th, 2017: *Introduction to R for Harvard Catalyst***

  This 3-day hands-on workshop will introduce participants to the basics of R and RStudio and their application to differential gene expression analysis on RNA-Seq count data.

#### 1. Workshops 

* **Next Generation Sequencing Introduction Series**

	([Galaxy-based](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/)) workshops on RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq to introduce basic concepts of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. The goal of these workshops are to enable researchers to design their studies appropriately and perform preliminary data analyses.

* **Basic Bioinformatics Skills Series**	

	Topics include R, data visualization using R, Python programming, Unix and high-performance computing (duration varies from half a day to three days).

#### 2.  In-Depth Next Generation Sequencing Analysis Courses

These intensive courses run for 10-12 days and are aimed at bench biologists interested in learning **how to perform independent, best practice NGS-based analyses**. Topics include:

- Unix & High-Performance Computing ([Orchestra](https://rc.hms.harvard.edu/#orchestra))
- NGS data analysis (RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, Variant calling)
- Statistical analysis using R
- Functional analysis


*No prior NGS or command line expertise is required for our workshops or courses unless explicitly stated.*
