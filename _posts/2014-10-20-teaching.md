Part of our mission as a service core to the HMS community is to **provide bioinformatics training**. We are doing this through workshops, in-depth courses and individual consults.


### **Training program**

We offer bioinformatics training workshops in several formats:

  One-day ([Galaxy-based](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/)) [NGS workshops](http://hbc.github.io/ngs-workshops/) on RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq: introduces basic concepts of NGS analysis using the easy point-and-click Galaxy interface. Enables researchers to design their studies appropriately and perform preliminary data analysis
 
  Workshops for basic bioinformatics skills including R, data visualization using R, Python programming, Unix and high-performance computing (varies from half a day to three days) 

  In-depth NGS analysis courses: 10-12 day courses designed to train researchers to independently perform a sequencing-based analyses using the Unix command line interface, R, and high-performance computing. 
 
*No prior NGS or command line expertise is required for most of our workshops unless stated explicitly.*

Please see below for a list of our Summer and Fall offerings; we will be adding more courses, and adding links to registration pages as soon as they become available.

***Upcoming workshops/courses:***

* **In-depth NGS data analysis course**: A 10-day (2-days a week for 5 weeks) course starting in **June 2016**. 

This intensive course will introduce partcipants to UNIX, High-Performance Computing, R, and enable them to perform Next-Generation Sequence (NGS) data analysis independently.

* **Introduction to UNIX and RNA-Seq data analysis**: 2 day workshop in **May 2016**.

This workshop will introduce participants to the command-line interface, compute clusters, and basic methods to perform differential gene expression analysis with RNA-Seq data.
