Part of our mission as a service core to the HMS community is to **provide bioinformatics training**. We are doing this through workshops, in-depth courses and individual consults.


### Workshop program 

Each month we run **one-day ([Galaxy-based](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/)) [NGS workshops](http://hbc.github.io/ngs-workshops/)** on RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, re-sequencing and other topics. These provide a basic understanding of the underlying technology and help with study designs and preliminary data analysis. No prior NGS or command line expertise is required. 
<br>**Our next courses are:**

* Introduction to RNA-Seq: **February 6th, 2015** 
* Introduction to ChIP-Seq: **March 9th, 2015**
* An in-depth [NGS Data analysis course](https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/hbctraining/NGS+Data+Analysis+Course,+Spring+2015) begins on **March 23rd, 2015** (see below for more details)

### [In-depth NGS course](https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/hbctraining/NGS+Data+Analysis+Course,+Spring+2015)

**We are now accepting applications for the [NGS Data Analysis course](https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/hbctraining/NGS+Data+Analysis+Course,+Spring+2015#NGSDataAnalysisCourse,Spring2015-AppReq). Application deadline is Feb 18th, 2015.** 

This course is aimed at bench biologists who are interested in learning about NGS-based genomic analysis. At the end of this course, participants will have the expertise to independently run data analysis for sequencing experiments.

* Unix & High performance compute environments (Orchestra)
* Software Carpentry-based introduction to R and version control with Git
* NGS analysis (command-line based, RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, Exome-Seq and Variant calling)
* Downstream functional analysis
* Data visualization with genome browsers

**Please check back for information about new workshops being scheduled.**
