Part of our mission as a service core to the HMS community is to **provide bioinformatics training**. We are doing this through workshops, in-depth courses and individual consults. **We offer bioinformatics training workshops in several formats:**



### One-day workshops:

One day ([Galaxy-based](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/)) [NGS workshops](http://hbc.github.io/ngs-workshops/) on RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq: introduces basic concepts of NGS analysis using the easy point-and-click Galaxy interface. Enables researchers to design their studies appropriately and perform preliminary data analysis



### Basic bioinformatics skills workshops:

Workshops for basic bioinformatics skills including R, data visualization using R, Python programming, Unix and high-performance computing (varies from half a day to three days) 



### In-depth NGS data analysis courses:

10-12 day courses designed to train researchers to independently perform a sequencing-based analyses using the Unix command line interface, R, and high-performance computing. 
 
*No prior NGS or command line expertise is required for most of our workshops unless stated explicitly.*



### Upcoming workshops/courses:

Please see below for a list of our Summer and Fall offerings; we will be adding more courses, and adding links to registration pages as soon as they become available.

* **June 2016: [In-depth NGS data analysis course](http://tinyurl.com/ngs-course-summer-2016)**: 

This 10-day in-depth course will instruct participants on the theoretical and practical concepts related to Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis, enabling them to perform these analyses independently.

* **May 12th and 13th, 2016: [Introduction to UNIX and RNA-Seq data analysis](https://hms-unix-may2016.eventbrite.com)**:
 
This workshop will introduce participants to the command-line interface, compute clusters, and basic methods to perform differential gene expression analysis with RNA-Seq data.
