Part of our mission as a service core to the HMS community is to **provide bioinformatics training**. We are doing this through workshops, in-depth courses and individual consults.


### Workshop program 

Each month we run **one-day ([Galaxy-based](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/)) [NGS workshops](http://hbc.github.io/ngs-workshops/)** on RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, re-sequencing and other topics. These provide a basic understanding of the underlying technology and help with study designs and preliminary data analysis. No prior NGS or command line expertise is required. 

<br>Please see below for a list of our Summer and Fall offerings; we will be adding more courses, announcing the dates for the fall courses, and adding links to the sign-up pages as soon as they become available.

* **June 26th**: Introduction to R and R graphics with ggplot2 (in collaboration with [IQSS](http://www.iq.harvard.edu/))
* **July 22nd**: A Hands-on Introduction to Python (in collaboration with [IQSS](http://www.iq.harvard.edu/)
* RNA-Seq with Galaxy (1 day)
* ChIP-Seq with Galaxy (1 day)
* Introduction to the command line interface (Unix) (2 days)
* Software Carpentry (2 days)
