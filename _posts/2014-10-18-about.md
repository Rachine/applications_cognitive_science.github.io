# Cogmaster
## Training in Cognitive science & applications

How does the human brain acquire or reacquire knowledge? How does it interact with technological objects or with other brains? The [Cogmaster](http://sapience.dec.ens.fr/cogmaster/www/e_01_portail.php) introduces a new track for students: **Cognitive Science & applications**.

Students will be exposed to the theoretical bases and examples of application of cognitive engineering during the [lectures sessions](#teaching), through presentation and discussion by representants of academia and the industry. Student will read, present and discuss relevant materials during the different classes, and acquire the necessary skills to resolve complex engineering problems involving human operators. In addition, students will apply the knowledge and skills during a M2 internship in companies or public administration in collaboration with researchers.

## Skills and profiles

TODO


 <!-- It  some of the major concepts and findings of the study of the brain and its functions (perception, action, decision-making, consciousness, memory, language, social cognition, etc.) and illustrates how this fundamental knowledge can help to resolve complex engineering problems involving human operators. -->

<!-- The [Cogmaster](http://sapience.dec.ens.fr/cogmaster/www/e_01_portail.php) provides bioinformatics support for Harvard Medical School researchers. This has been made possible through funding from the [HMS Tools and Technology Program](http://hms.harvard.edu/departments/tools-and-technology) (TnT). -->

<!-- Our Core staff are available to help with the **management, integration, and contextual analysis of high-throughput biological data**, focusing on **next-generation sequencing support**. We [provide consulting, training, tools, databases and best practices](#support), while fostering collaboration and a community of bioinformatic activities. We also build unified infrastructure to support a diverse set of experimental systems and high-throughput biological data.

With the help of this funding, HBC can now **offer subsidized [consults](#fees)** to researchers with a primary affiliation in one of the [Basic and Social Science Departments on the Quad](http://hms.harvard.edu/departments). Please [contact us](#contact) with any questions and support requests you might have. -->
