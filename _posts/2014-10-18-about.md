# Bioinformatics Support for HMS

The [HSPH Bioinformatics Core](https://hsphbio.ghost.io/) (HBC) — through funding from the [HMS Tools and Technology Program](http://hms.harvard.edu/departments/tools-and-technology) (TnT) and the [Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center](http://www.neurodiscovery.harvard.edu/) (HNDC) — provides a single point of contact for Harvard Medical School researchers interested in bioinformatics support.

Core staff aid researchers within the Harvard community with the **management, integration and contextual analysis of biological high-throughput data**, focusing on **next-generation sequencing support**. We [provide consulting, training, tools, databases and best practices](#services), foster collaboration and a community of bioinformatics activities, and build a unified infrastructure supporting a diverse set of experimental systems and high-throughput biological data.

With the help of this funding HBC can now **offer subsidized [consults](#fees)** to researchers with a primary affiliation in one of the [Basic and Social Science Departments on the Quad](http://hms.harvard.edu/departments) or any affiliation with the HNDC. Please [contact us](#contact) with any questions and support requests you might have.
